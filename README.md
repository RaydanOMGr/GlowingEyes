# Glowing Eyes
A minecraft mod to make your eyes glow, inspired by the mod [Vampirism](https://github.com/TeamLapen/Vampirism)<br>
 
## How to download
You can download it on [CurseForge](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/glowing-eyes) or [Modrinth](https://modrinth.com/mod/glowing-eyes)<br>

If you decide to build the mod from the source here (on github) you might encounter some issues.

## Usage
~~You can toggle your glowing eyes on by doing typing `/eyes toggle on` in chat, and you can toggle them off by typing `/eyes toggle off`<br>
To change the type of your eyes, type `/eyes type <number>` where `<number>` can be any number from 0 to 16. I have taken textures 0 to 15 from the [Vampirism](https://github.com/TeamLapen/Vampirism) mod, 16 I have made myself, but I might add some kind of customization later~~ gonna fix this later

## Planned features
- ~~An eye selection GUI, possibly even an editor of some kind~~ Done!

Suggest your ideas in the issues section!

## Known Issues
- It seems ReplayMod doesn't record the glowing eyes, but I don't see it as crucial for now. In case more people want this feature, I'll try to fix it -- Update: I have looked into the issue and I might have an idea how to fix it. -- Update 2: I don't have an idea how to fix it.
