# Glowing Eyes
A minecraft mod to make your eyes glow, inspired by the mod [Vampirism](https://github.com/TeamLapen/Vampirism)<br>
 
## How to download
You can download it on [CurseForge](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/glowing-eyes)

## Usage
You can toggle your glowing eyes on by doing typing `/eyes toggle on` in chat, and you can toggle them off by typing `/eyes toggle off`<br>
To change the type of your eyes, type `/eyes type <number>` where `<number>` can be any number from 0 to 16. I have taken textures 0 to 15 from the [Vampirism](https://github.com/TeamLapen/Vampirism) mod, 16 I have made myself, but I might add some kind of customization later

## Planned features
- An eye selection GUI, possibly even an editor of some kind

Suggest your ideas in the issues section!

## Known Issues
- Some users have issues with their skins faces when the eyes are on -- Update: I might have fixed the issue, but I'm not sure, gotta try it out
- It seems ReplayMod doesn't record the glowing eyes, but I don't see it as crucial for now. In case more people want this feature, I'll try to fix it -- Update: I have looked into the issue and I might have an idea how to fix it.

## Thanks!
